# DSUI Design System Progress

## Current Phase: Phase 4 - Advanced Interactions
**Status**: Ready to Begin  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-15 15:30:00  
**Estimated Completion**: 4-5 hours

## Implementation Overview

Building a comprehensive Laravel + Bulma + AlpineJS + HTMX design system with three architectural layers:
- **Structure Layer**: Blade components with Bulma CSS classes
- **Behavior Layer**: AlpineJS for client-side interactions  
- **Communication Layer**: HTMX for server communication

## Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture âœ…
**Objective**: Replace Tailwind with Bulma + add AlpineJS/HTMX foundation

- [x] Create CLAUDE.md for progress tracking
- [x] Create comprehensive design system plan documentation  
- [x] Remove Tailwind CSS from package.json and Vite config
- [x] Add Bulma CSS, AlpineJS, HTMX dependencies
- [x] Update Vite configuration for new asset pipeline (modern @use syntax, SCSS support)
- [x] Create component directory structure in resources/views/components/ds/
- [x] Setup Design System Service Provider for component registration
- [x] Create base component classes with shared functionality
- [x] Setup documentation routes /design-system/*

## Phase 2: Core Component Architecture âœ…
**Objective**: Establish the three-layer component pattern

- [x] Create component naming conventions and standards (x-ds-* syntax)
- [x] Build base component class with Bulma integration  
- [x] Implement Alpine.js component registry system (DS.component namespace)
- [x] Setup HTMX endpoint routing for component communication (/api/ds/*)
- [x] Create first reference component (Button) with all three layers
- [x] Build component documentation template system
- [x] Test component integration end-to-end

**Expected Deliverables**:
- âœ… Clean asset pipeline with Bulma/Alpine/HTMX
- âœ… Component architecture foundation
- âœ… Development environment ready
- âœ… Progress tracking system in place

## Phase 2: Core Component Architecture âœ…  
**Status**: Completed  
**Objective**: Establish the three-layer component pattern

- [x] Create component naming conventions and standards
- [x] Build base component class with Bulma integration  
- [x] Implement Alpine.js component registry system
- [x] Setup HTMX endpoint routing for component communication
- [x] Create first reference component (Button) with all three layers
- [x] Build component documentation template
- [x] Test component integration end-to-end

## Phase 3: Essential Components âœ…
**Status**: Completed  
**Objective**: Build core UI components needed for any application

- [x] Form Controls: Select (multi/searchable), Checkbox (indeterminate), Radio (groups)
- [x] Typography: Heading (H1-H6 semantic), Text (flexible content with features)
- [ ] Links: Accessible navigation with external indicators
- [ ] Basic Layout: Container, grid, card components
- [ ] Feedback: Basic alerts and loading states

## Phase 4: Advanced Interactions ðŸ“‹
**Status**: Pending  
**Objective**: Complex components with rich interactions

- [ ] Modal System: Accessible modals with focus management
- [ ] Form Wizards: Multi-step forms with validation
- [ ] Data Tables: Sortable, filterable tables with HTMX
- [ ] Advanced Inputs: Select dropdowns, file uploads, date pickers
- [ ] Notification System: Toast notifications with queue
- [ ] Tab System: Dynamic tabs with lazy loading

## Phase 5: Polish & Production ðŸ“‹
**Status**: Pending  
**Objective**: Production readiness and developer experience

- [ ] Performance Optimization: Bundle analysis, lazy loading
- [ ] Accessibility Audit: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- [ ] Testing Suite: Component tests with Laravel Dusk
- [ ] Documentation Complete: All components documented
- [ ] Developer Tools: Artisan commands for component generation
- [ ] Style Guide: Automated design token documentation

## Component Inventory

### Base Components
- [x] Button (all variants and states) - **COMPLETE**
- [x] Input (text, email, password, number) - **COMPLETE**
- [x] Textarea (with auto-resize) - **COMPLETE**
- [x] Select (single/multi with search) - **COMPLETE**
- [x] Checkbox (with indeterminate states) - **COMPLETE**
- [x] Radio (with group functionality) - **COMPLETE**
- [ ] File Upload (drag-and-drop)

### Typography Components
- [x] Heading (H1-H6 with semantic HTML) - **COMPLETE**
- [x] Text (flexible content with enhanced features) - **COMPLETE**
- [ ] Link (accessibility features)

### Layout Components  
- [ ] Container (responsive)
- [ ] Grid (Bulma grid enhancement)
- [ ] Card (header/body/footer)
- [ ] Navbar (responsive)
- [ ] Breadcrumb (dynamic)
- [ ] Sidebar (collapsible)

### Feedback Components
- [ ] Modal (accessible)
- [ ] Alert (dismissible)
- [ ] Toast (notification queue)
- [ ] Loading (spinner/skeleton)
- [ ] Tooltip (positioned)
- [ ] Popover (rich content)

### Complex Components
- [ ] Data Table (sortable/filterable)
- [ ] Form Wizard (multi-step)
- [ ] Image Gallery (lightbox)
- [ ] Chart Integration (dynamic)
- [ ] Timeline (events)
- [ ] Tabs (lazy loading)

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **Component Naming**: `x-ds-{category}-{name}` for Blade components
- **CSS Classes**: `ds-{component}--{variant}` for custom styling
- **Alpine Components**: `DS.component.{name}` namespace
- **HTMX Endpoints**: `/api/ds/{component}/{action}` pattern

### Key Technical Choices
- **Bulma CSS**: Chosen for semantic classes and flexibility
- **AlpineJS**: Lightweight reactive framework for component behavior
- **HTMX**: Server-side rendering with progressive enhancement
- **Vite**: Modern build tool for asset compilation

### Development Workflow
1. Component PHP class with props validation
2. Blade template with Bulma structure
3. Alpine.js behavior integration  
4. HTMX server communication endpoints
5. Documentation page with examples
6. Testing and accessibility validation

## Known Issues
*None currently*

## Next Session Priorities
1. Complete remaining Phase 3 components (Link, Container, Grid, Card, Alert, Loading)
2. Begin Phase 4 advanced interactions (Modal, Tabs, Data Tables)
3. Setup component documentation examples
4. Begin accessibility audit and testing
